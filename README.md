==============================

JSD is yet another javascript documentation tool. Like [JSDoc](http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net/), [JSDoc Toolkit](http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/), [jGrouseDoc](http://code.google.com/p/jgrousedoc/), [YUI Doc](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/), and others, it parses [Javadoc](http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/)-style comments in javascript files and produces html-formatted api documentation.

JSD is different than other tools because:

1. JSD is written in 100% javascript
2. JSD ignores everything outside of `/** */` comments

Because JSD is written in javascript, it's easy for javascript developers to customize (for example, to handle custom javadoc tags). And because JSD ignores the syntax of your javascript, you can code any way you please; JSD will extract whatever you tag into your api docs (you can even use it to document things that aren't javascript).
